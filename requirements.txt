# comment for `pytest-selenium`
# reason for pinning to `2.0.1` is that their github repo's master looks to add support for selenium 4, which we haven't done yet.
# maybe once we upgrade to selenium 4, we can unpin or make the librarie's version greater.
# a point to note is that this library is not pushed to PyPi after this release, and this is more than a year old.
